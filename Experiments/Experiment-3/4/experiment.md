FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;
```

## Image Explanation

The screenshot shows the result of a `LEFT JOIN` between `Employee` and `Bonus`, filtered to keep employees whose bonus is below 1000 or missing. This returns the required employee names with their bonus values.

## Result

The SQL query correctly returns employees who either have a bonus less than 1000 or have no bonus at all.
